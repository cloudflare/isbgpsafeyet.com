`Is BGP Safe Yet?` is an initiative by Cloudflare to make BGP more secure by deploying RPKI.

A list of major operators tracks the status of their RPKI deployments into three categories:
`safe`, `partially safe` and `unsafe`.
[Contributions to the list are welcome](https://github.com/cloudflare/isbgpsafeyet.com/blob/master/public/data/operators.csv).

The website also provides a simple test to determine if your operator is filtering RPKI invalid prefixes.
