**Is BGP safe yet?** is an initiative by Cloudflare to make BGP more secure by deploying RPKI.

A list of major operators tracks the status of their RPKI deployments into three categories:
safe, partially safe and unsafe. Contributions are welcome.

[Contribute to the list →](https://github.com/cloudflare/isbgpsafeyet.com/blob/master/data/operators.csv)

The website also provides a simple test to determine if your operator is filtering RPKI invalid prefixes.
